# 📁 Project: DNS Log Analysis using Splunk SIEM

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates how to ingest and analyze DNS log files using **Splunk SIEM**. It focuses on extracting meaningful insights from DNS traffic to detect potential threats and anomalies.  
This was my first hands-on Splunk project, completed by following a YouTube course by **[@0xrajneesh](https://www.youtube.com/@0xrajneesh)**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Upload and parse sample DNS log files into Splunk.
- Extract critical fields such as source IP, destination IP, domain name, query type, and response code.
- Use SPL (Search Processing Language) to detect anomalies and identify suspicious domains.
- Apply regex filters and statistical functions to analyze DNS traffic behavior.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- A working Splunk instance installed and configured.
- Sample DNS log files (plain text format) containing relevant DNS events.
- Basic understanding of Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL).

## 📥 Data Ingestion Steps

### 1. Prepare DNS Log Files
Ensure your DNS logs contain fields like:
- `src_ip` (source IP)
- `dest_ip` (destination IP)
- `fqdn` (fully qualified domain name)
- `query_type`
- `response_code`

### 2. Upload Logs to Splunk
- Navigate to: `Settings > Add Data > Upload`
- Select your DNS log file.

### 3. Set Source Type
- Assign a source type (e.g., `dns_sample`).
- Choose the correct **index** and **host**.

### 4. Verify Ingestion
Run a basic search to confirm data ingestion:
```spl
index=<your_dns_index> sourcetype=dns_sample
