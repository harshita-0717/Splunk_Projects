# üìÅ Project: DNS Log Analysis using Splunk SIEM

## üìù Description
This project demonstrates how to ingest and analyze DNS log files using **Splunk SIEM**. It focuses on extracting meaningful insights from DNS traffic to detect potential threats and anomalies.  
This was my first hands-on Splunk project, completed by following a YouTube course by **[@0xrajneesh](https://www.youtube.com/@0xrajneesh)**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Upload and parse sample DNS log files into Splunk.
- Extract critical fields such as source IP, destination IP, domain name, query type, and response code.
- Use SPL (Search Processing Language) to detect anomalies and identify suspicious domains.
- Apply regex filters and statistical functions to analyze DNS traffic behavior.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- A working Splunk instance installed and configured.
- Sample DNS log files (plain text format) with relevant DNS events.
- Basic understanding of Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL).

---

## üì• Data Ingestion Steps

1. **Prepare DNS Log Files**
   - Ensure logs include fields like source IP, FQDN, query type, response code, etc.

2. **Upload Logs to Splunk**
   - Go to: `Settings > Add Data > Upload`
   - Select your DNS log file.

3. **Set Source Type**
   - Use an appropriate source type (e.g., `dns_sample`).
   - Assign correct index and host.

4. **Verify Ingestion**
   - Use a basic search to verify data:
     ```spl
     index=<your_dns_index> sourcetype=dns_sample
     ```

## üîç DNS Log Analysis in Splunk

### 1. Basic DNS Event Search
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample

### 2. Filter DNS-Related Events with Regex
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | regex _raw="(?i)\b(dns|domain|query|response|port 53)\b"

### 3. Identify Traffic Spikes by Domain
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | stats count by fqdn

### 4. Top Sources by Domain Queries
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | top fqdn, src_ip

### 5. Investigate Known Malicious Domains
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample fqdn="maliciousdomain.com"


## üìà Outcome
    - Successfully identified high-traffic DNS domains.

    - Detected anomalies and abnormal patterns in DNS activity.

    - Built a strong foundational understanding of using Splunk for security log analysis.

    - Laid the groundwork for future projects in threat detection and security operations.
