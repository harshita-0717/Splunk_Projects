# DNS Log Analysis using Splunk SIEM

## üìù Description

This project showcases the ingestion and analysis of DNS log files utilizing **Splunk SIEM**. The primary focus is on extracting actionable insights from DNS traffic to identify potential threats and anomalies. This project marked my initial hands-on experience with Splunk, undertaken by following a comprehensive YouTube course by [@0xrajneesh](https://www.youtube.com/@0xrajneesh).

## üéØ Objectives

  * Upload and parse sample DNS log files into Splunk.
  * Extract critical fields such as source IP, destination IP, domain name, query type, and response code.
  * Utilize SPL (Search Processing Language) to detect anomalies and identify suspicious domains.
  * Apply regex filters and statistical functions to analyze DNS traffic behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

  * A functional Splunk instance, properly installed and configured.
  * Sample DNS log files (plain text format) containing relevant DNS events.
  * A basic understanding of Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL).

## üì• Data Ingestion Steps

### 1\. Prepare DNS Log Files

Ensure your log files include essential fields such as source IP, Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), query type, and response code.

### 2\. Upload Logs to Splunk

Navigate to `Settings > Add Data > Upload` and select your DNS log file(s).

### 3\. Set Source Type

Assign an appropriate source type (e.g., `dns_sample`). Configure the correct index and host for the ingested data.

### 4\. Verify Ingestion

Confirm successful data ingestion by executing a basic search:

```splunk
index=<your_dns_index> sourcetype=dns_sample
```

## üîç DNS Log Analysis in Splunk

### 1\. Basic DNS Event Search

This search retrieves all events from your specified DNS sourcetype:

```splunk
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample
```

### 2\. Filter DNS-Related Events with Regex

Use regular expressions to filter for events explicitly related to DNS activity:

```splunk
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | regex _raw="(?i)\b(dns|domain|query|response|port 53)\b"
```

### 3\. Identify Traffic Spikes by Domain

Analyze the count of queries per FQDN to identify domains with high traffic:

```splunk
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | stats count by fqdn
```

### 4\. Top Sources by Domain Queries

Determine which source IPs are making the most queries for specific domains:

```splunk
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | top fqdn, src_ip
```

### 5\. Investigate Known Malicious Domains

Search for activity related to specific known malicious domains:

```splunk
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample fqdn="maliciousdomain.com"
```

*(Note: Replace "maliciousdomain.com" with the actual domain you wish to investigate.)*

## üìà Outcome

  * Successfully identified high-traffic DNS domains.
  * Detected anomalies and abnormal patterns in DNS activity.
  * Gained a strong foundational understanding of using Splunk for security log analysis.
  * Established a basis for future projects in threat detection and security operations.
